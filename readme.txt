Real-time Public Transport Tracker with Predictive Analytics for NSW, Australia


Real-time Public Transport Tracker for NSW - a cloud-based solution that uses machine learning to predict bus and train arrival times with remarkable accuracy. As frequent public transport users, we identified the need for smarter, more reliable predictions beyond static timetables. Our application leverages nine AWS services in a distributed architecture to process real-time data and deliver intelligent forecasts. Over the next 20 minutes, we'll demonstrate how we've solved real-world transportation challenges using advanced cloud computing technologies.
